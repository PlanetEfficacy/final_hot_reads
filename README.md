This is a micro-service for my final assessment at Turing. To run it on your machine:
`git clone https://github.com/PlanetEfficacy/final_hot_reads`

`bundle`

`rake db:create`

`rake db:migrate`

`rails s -p 3001` 

Note, the URLockBox will only use the deployed version of this app, not a locally running version.
